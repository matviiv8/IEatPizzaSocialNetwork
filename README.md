# IEatPizzaSocialNetwork

The founder of the "I eat pizza" startup turned to you with a request to implement his idea. This will be the first
A worldwide social network that unites pizza lovers. The site consists of two pages:

1) Submission form:
    - Name
    - Email
    - Button "I ate pizza!"

    When the button is pressed, the data is sent to the server and stored in the database, the user gets to the feed page

2) A channel is a list of form submitters with names and submission dates, as well as the total number of form submissions for each user (counted by email). An example of a record:

    "22.10 11.11.2021 Vasyl already ate pizza twice"

Pages must be linked to each other.

For implementation, use http://www.asp.net/mvc To access the database, you can use any convenient tool, including Entity framework, as well as any convenient database

The source code must be placed in an open repository at https://github.com/
